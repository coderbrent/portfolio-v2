# portfolio-v2

Project Objective -

To re-design my portfolio in order to showcase my most current dev abilities. I'd like to create a blog on this portforlio site that I can log in to and use to generate general blogs about coding, my career etc. I'd like the blog to be a highlight piece of my current skills.

Project Dependencies  -

- Firebase
- Materialize
- Normalize
- Bootstrap
- Moment
- FontAwesome
- Google Fonts

Styling/Design Theme -

I'd like to incorporate some neat CSS features (materialize) as well as standard use of Bootstrap components. I'd also like to incorporate gradients into the UI. Furthermore, I will use Google material icons.

Site Structure -

The site will be a standard portfolio with links to:

- About Me
- Portfolio
- Contact Me
- Blog

The blog will be my showcase piece. I want to use what I've learned thus far to design a useful blogging tool for my site. It will possess the following features:

- Administrator Login
- Blog creation/submission form that, upon submission, shows who submitted the blog and when they did it (moment, timestamped).
- Keeps track of blogs in Firebase.
- Blog will also allow for users to "thumbs up" the content. Want a thumbs down? Go ahead asshole, request that feature. I fucking dare you.

Timeline - 

This project is already overdue (it was supposed to be done last Saturday). Since I'll be submitting it late, I want to make sure I get it right. MVP will be defined as completing:

- About Me
- Portfolio
- Contact Me

The blog will be a "v2" feature. I will actively work on this, though.
